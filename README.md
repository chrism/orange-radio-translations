# Notes

The current version seems fine.

All these changes are just my personal opinion (and attempt to match the Orange text style guide).

Feel free to use or not!

- tried to clarify the language of exit modal (also, close may be a bit confusing for this one)
- consitency of favourites/favorites spelling
- simplified language in form of The... to be more compact
